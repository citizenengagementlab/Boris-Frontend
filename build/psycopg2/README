psycopg2 - Python-PostgreSQL Database Adapter
********************************************

psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming
language.  psycopg2 was written with the aim of being very small and fast,
and stable as a rock.

psycopg2 is different from the other database adapter because it was
designed for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy
lots of cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or
UPDATEs. psycopg2 also provides full asynchronous operations and support
for coroutine libraries.

psycopg2 can compile and run on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, MacOS X and
Windows architecture. It supports Python versions from 2.4 onwards and
PostgreSQL versions from 7.4 onwards.

psycopg2 is free software ("free as in freedom" but I like beer too.)
It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or
later plus an exception to allow OpenSSL (libpq) linking; see LICENSE for
more details.
