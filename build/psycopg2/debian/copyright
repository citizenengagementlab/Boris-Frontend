License for psycopg2, ZPsycopgDA and psycopg2da:

    psycopg is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    On Debian GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the GNU General
    Public License can be found in '/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL'.

    As a special exception, specific permission is granted for the GPLed
    code in this distribition to be linked to OpenSSL and PostgreSQL libpq
    without invoking GPL clause 2(b).

    Note that the GPL was chosen to avoid proprietary adapters based on
    psycopg code. Using psycopg in a proprietary product (even bundling
    psycopg with the proprietary product) is fine as long as:

     1. psycopg is called from Python only using only the provided API
        (i.e., no linking with C code and no C modules based on it); and

     2. all the other points of the GPL are respected (you offer a copy
        of psycopg's source code, and so on.)


License for the files tests/dbapi20.py and scripts/ext2html.py:

    These modules have been placed in the public domain.
